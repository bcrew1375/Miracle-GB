# Miracle-GB
A simple monochrome Gameboy emulator for Windows written in C using the SDL2 library and Visual Studio 2017.  The emulator is in very early stages.  There is currently no sound, no save files, and display is a little glitchy.

Download Miracle GB.exe and SDL2.dll from Release folder to run.  You will need a Gameboy ROM image to use with the emulator.   The emulator can run a number of commercial games, such as Donkey Kong and Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.
The codebase is currently being rewritten to be more maintainable.

Controls are hard-coded for now:

A button = F  B button = D  Select button = Space Start button = Enter  D-Pad = Arrow keys
